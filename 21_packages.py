 What is PIP?
- PIP stands for "Pip Installs Packages".
- It is the default package manager for Python and is used to install, manage, and 
    uninstall Python packages (libraries) from the Python Package Index (PyPI).
- PyPI is an online repository of software packages for Python, offering thousands of prebuilt libraries.

Why Use PIP?
1. Ease of Use: PIP simplifies the process of installing and managing Python packages.
2. Large Ecosystem: Access thousands of third-party libraries from PyPI.
3. Dependency Management: Automatically handles dependencies required by a package.

    2. Run the script in the terminal:
       python get-pip.py

  - For Linux/macOS:

# Basic PIP Commands

# 1. Installing a Package

   pip install <package_name>

   Example:
   pip install requests
   - This installs the `requests` library, used for making HTTP requests.

# 2. Upgrading a Package
   
   pip install --upgrade <package_name>
   
   Example:

   pip install --upgrade flask

# 3. Uninstalling a Package

   pip uninstall <package_name>
   
   Example:

   pip uninstall numpy

# 4. Listing Installed Packages

   pip list

   Example output:

   Package    Version
   ---        ---
   Flask      2.3.0
   requests   2.28.1


# 5. Checking Package Information

   pip show <package_name>

   Example:

   pip show django

   Output:

   Name: Django
   Version: 4.2
   Summary: A high-level Python Web framework.
   Location: /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages

# 6. Installing Specific Package Versions

   pip install <package_name>==<version>

   Example:
   
   pip install pandas==1.4.3

# 7. Saving Installed Packages to a File

   pip freeze > requirements.txt

   - This generates a `requirements.txt` file, listing all installed packages and their versions.

# 8. Installing Packages from a Requirements File

   pip install -r requirements.txt

   - Useful for replicating environments across projects.
