# Initialize x with the value 5
x = 5 	

# Examples of various compound assignment operators

# x += 3 	    # Add 3 to x and assign the result back to x (equivalent to x = x + 3)
# x -= 3 	    # Subtract 3 from x and assign the result back to x (equivalent to x = x - 3)
# x *= 3      # Multiply x by 3 and assign the result back to x (equivalent to x = x * 3)
# x /= 3 	    # Divide x by 3 and assign the result back to x (equivalent to x = x / 3)
# x %= 3 	    # Take the modulo (remainder) of x divided by 3 and assign back to x
# x //= 3     # Perform integer division by 3 and assign the result back to x
# x **= 3     # Raise x to the power of 3 and assign the result back to x
# print(x := 3) 	# Walrus operator: assign 3 to x and print the value in one step

# Print the current value of x
print(x)
